## Project Description

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Description

Class project to build a portfolio to display my coding work and to eventually use to show potential employers as i progress in the class and build a body of work.
```
Build of this website started with a wiring exercise to layout teh design on paper.  This scheme was then transferred into HTML in flow only before populating with actual content.  once basic flow and semantic convention was finished, the HTML was populated with content inclusive of links  to external sources, images, hero graphic, text, links to portfolio work.  a seoerate HTML was built to hold a pdf of my resume and links were connected between pages.  CSS was used to finalize all the section formats and to address flow concerns.
