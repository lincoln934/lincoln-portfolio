            Highly skilled leader seeking executive management position.  Having spent 31-years in management roles with increasing levels of responsibility with a leading hospitality management company focused on higher education dining accounts, this leader has exceptional skills in the areas of team development, client relationship building, trust building, process and systems implementation, margin and sales growth, problem solving, and strategic thinking, and driving accountability in a complex work environment.
          </p><b></b>
          <p class="bio">
            With a background in leadership and management which was highly focused on strategy and solving complex problems, I am highly capable of applying those skills in my newest area of focus and interest, coding, website development, and app building.  Beyond the strategy and problem solving skills that are necessary to determine the most effective and efficient way to develop code, I am also highly creative and have historically used that creativity as a Chef, as a wood worker, and as a painter.  These skills transfer well into the design needs in website development.
